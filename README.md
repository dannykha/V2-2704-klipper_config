# Macros

My print_start command consists of most of the macros I utilize on a daily. The only other ones are load/unlaod filaments.
Automatic Z calibration is very nice and has gotten me very consistent first layer prints with the Klicky Probe.

# Tuning Notes

Utilizing [Andrew Ellis Tuning Guide](https://github.com/AndrewEllis93/Print-Tuning-Guide) for all my tuning needs.

# To-Do Notes

* Redo the magnetic sheet on the bed. Will get better first layer? Mesh varience currently at 0.1836 which is okay but could be better!
* Stealthburner.
* LGX Lite vs Oribter 2.0 test.
